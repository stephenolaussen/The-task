3.3. Lesson - Git (part 1)
The task

This lesson taught us about Git basics, such as Git setup, creating a GitHub account, repository, and commits. We saw how to push the last to the remote repository.

In this task, you need to:

Create a new repository.

Open it in VS Code.

Create a file “Test.txt” and put some text in it.

Create a commit containing the file creation.

Push the commit to the remote repository.

Change the file again, but from GitHub.

Create another commit with the file change.

Pull remote changes from VS Code.
